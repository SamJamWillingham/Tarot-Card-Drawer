# Tarot-Card-Drawer

//I made this in my spare time to practice the skills I've learned during a SheCodes Workshop. It draws a random card from a full Tarot deck. 
The repository includes HTML, CSS, JS, the png imgs of each card, and another vanilla JS file that is an array containing the full tarot deck. Each card has a title, 
card img, and an "about". The content was pulled from Tarot.com and cited in the footer at the bottom.
