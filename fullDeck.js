Besides, intuition is your ace in the hole. Respond in a spontaneous manner to what is right in front of you. There is no reason to hold yourself back.`,

    about: `The Hermit advises that you think things through carefully. The demands on you have been high, giving you scant time for reflection. While you have a gift for understanding the larger implications involved, you need some private time to consider the steps to take in the future.

You need more seclusion and time to assimilate and process.<br />Now may be the moment for you to tell everyone to leave you alone. When you are fully ready, you will be able and willing to give others what they need.`,

Eventually, you will be released a little wiser and not much the worse for wear. You will come to realize in time how you collaborated with the problem.

    about: `The Death card advises you to detach from the old order. You may want to close accounts, complete unfinished tasks, and gather your harvest. It is time to move on.

This is not an excuse to reject others or hurt them in any way. It is simply a time to move toward your ultimate interests.<br />Do not allow nostalgia and outworn loyalties to hold you back.

Your vision shows you that a radical change has already been unleashed by forces much larger than mere mortals, and therefore you are no longer resisting.<br />Now you may be at the forefront, acknowledging and accepting the bracing presence of the future bursting in on the present. Try to mediate the harsher parts of the changes as they unfold, so the most vulnerable are the most cushioned.

    about: `The Moon card advises that you trust your instincts and intuitions. Your intuitive body, which is connected to all living things, is sharper and quicker than the cultivated, civilized self. The everyday mind may not be prepared for strange oceanic circumstances. Plus, it has no game plan. Your intuitive body will support you unerringly if you do not interfere with or try to control what you perceive. A better approach would be to meditate. Try to just be a witness. Do nothing; let nature carry you forward. This may be your best option in this situation.`,

    cardFile: `<img src="src/20-judgement.jpg" alt="Judgement" class="cardImg">`,

At the same time, invest your energies in new growth.<br />It's not necessary to reject others, but refuse to be manipulated by those who cry foul. This process isn't about them anyway. It is about you and the desire you feel to change your life and become a more complete person.`,

  {
    name: "The World",
    cardFile: `<img src="src/21-world.jpg" alt="The World" class="cardImg">`,
    about: `The World card may be giving you permission to do whatever you want. Presently, your motivation is close to the will of the divine. Even if you commit an error, it will be turned to the greater good. Stay active and just keep moving forward. It is unnecessary to keep checking or interrupting your spontaneity with calculation. Rather than look for consensus or affirmation from others, simply dance the dance. In other words, express yourself, react naturally, and let the chips fall where they may.<br />What matters is divine intention. Whether or not human beings approve is less important. If you allow your ego to inflate, however, you cease to be useful to the greater plan.`,
